# Real-Time Complaint Monitoring System
## Objective
To build a real-time complaint monitoring system that will allow service-based institutions, such as banks, to categorize incoming customer complaints automatically and track the frequency of complaints by category. This system aims to help institutions address recurring issues faster, thereby improving customer satisfaction and retention.

## Problem Statement
Customer complaints are a critical indicator of service quality. However, organizations such as banks that directly serve clients often struggle to manage large volumes of complaints effectively. This can lead to delayed resolutions and frustrated customers. Without proper categorization and monitoring, companies cannot identify the most frequent or urgent issues that require immediate action, causing dissatisfaction and potential customer loss.
